Jessica S.,5,Amazing,10/27/2023,Very light and gives a natural blush look.,Verified Buyer,10,256
Savannah,5,"Does not cause acne, lasts all day... not for lips",10/26/2023,I have used just about an entire stick of Tenderly and I LOVVVEEE this product. Has not caused any irritation and the color lasts all day if I don't touch my face. I use a Morphe blush to buff around the edges when I put circles on my cheeks. I do NOT use this on my lips. Way too dry for my lips.,Verified Buyer,10,244
Breanna F.,5,Pretty,10/23/2023,Pretty color. Subtle and natural looking contour. Easy to apply. Moisturizing and doesn’t irritate my skin.,Verified Buyer,14,240
YJ A.,5,Amazing!!!,10/22/2023,"I am extremely pleased with my recent cosmetics order. The eyeshadow's texture and color are absolutely stunning. It applies smoothly, and within just 30 seconds, the creamy texture adheres flawlessly to the skin, delivering a truly beautiful color. The multi-stick is wonderfully moisturizing and applies thinly and softly, imparting an elegant hue. The mini sets are not only adorable but also incredibly practical, and the overall product quality is exceptional. These cosmetics complement my skin tone perfectly, achieving a natural and healthy makeup look. I'm already eager to explore the rest of the product range!",Verified Buyer,15,227
Cindy W.,5,Multi-stick,10/17/2023,Love it and easily blend-able with other sticks for the perfect color!,Verified Buyer,28,216
Jazz M.,5,"Fantastic, dewy, glowy blush!",09/27/2023,"I first received this blush as part of a pallet pack, and fell in love with this shade (tenderly) immediately. It's wonderful: easy to apply wherever you like; feels luxurious and moisturizing (like it's good for your skin), gives a natural rosy appearance to the cheeks (and lips) which is subtle enough to look natural, it makes me look healthy and glowing (even on bad days when I'm dehydrated or tired and my skin isn't looking that fresh).
It makes me feel beautiful, but not overly 'made-up', and the tint is very flattering and romantic on pale skin. It has a nice smooth texture and is so easy to rub in (or dab). It works just as well on bare skin as it does after applying Ilia's tinted sunscreen serum (or any zinc sunscreen). Very happy I got it in the larger size as I use it nearly every day - and have received so many compliments! Total winner here, folks!",Verified Buyer,12,58
Kimberly E.,5,love my cheeks!,09/21/2023,"Sweet, blendable color that go from shy to bold!",Verified Buyer,28,56
Brittany H.,5,Quick & Easy Natural Contour,09/15/2023,I love this color -- it looks so natural on my skin but adds just enough contrast for a quick contour under my cheekbones.,Verified Buyer,29,62
Kate W.,5,A gorgeous time saver!,09/13/2023,"So, most of us are in a rush these days- and if you’re not, you just don’t want to have to use a bunch of products to create a beautiful/fresh looking face. Having a multi-stick in your make up routine is a game changer, it creates a cohesive look in a matter of seconds. I received a free sample of Ilia’s multi-stick in the shade Dear Ruby, from pinchme in exchange for my honest review. I want to be clear, I would purchase any of Ilia’s products (whether I was incentivized or not), they are an awesome clean brand. I absolutely adore the color of this multi-stick, It’s a poppy red and it just makes me look and feel more alive. I have very pale skin, and naturally dark circles under my eyes. When I don’t wear make up, my dark circles are the first thing that you notice. If you look at my before and after pictures, you’ll see that my face looks more alive after using Ilia’s multi-stick on my cheeks and lips (and it detracts from my dark circles). It’s pretty amazing that using a multi stick and taking 30 seconds to apply it and blend would make that big of a difference, but it really does! Why I love this Ilia multi-stick: all of the ingredients are natural so it’s like skin care and make up in one (think skin benefits), It has a nice texture that blends beautifully on skin, It feels light on my skin and never sticky, and it wears well throughout the day. Not to mention it’s a space saver, having one multi stick for multiple purposes. It has no scent which I love, because It is unnecessary for beauty products to be scented. It is super easy to use and quick as quick can be (when you are running late and look like death, just take 30 seconds to apply the multi-stick and it’s like a new you). Clean ingredients, amazing color pay off (buildable coverage which is great), a smooth texture, and a healthy looking face. Need I say more?!",Verified Buyer,140,18
Kari,4,Cheeky Highlighter!,09/13/2023,This product really highlighted and brought out my high cheekbones. I tried fine romance berry and it was the perfect shade for my skin tone. So thankful to have had the opportunity to try this product! The cleanser also worked really well in removing my makeup without feeling too drying.,Verified Buyer,10,179
Kai C.,5,Wonderful multi stick for cheeks and lips! My new fave,09/12/2023,"Over the years, I’ve tried my share of Ilia products, both makeup & skincare, and have really enjoyed them but I think this is my favorite product I’ve tried thus far. The Ilia Multi-Stick is a 3-in-1 product that can be used as a blush, lip tint and even eyelid color. It’s a smooth cream formula that has skin loving ingredients like avocado oil, orange peel wax and shea butter. I received the shade Dear Ruby, a beautiful poppy red. Ilia products are always made with ingredients that enhance and highlight your natural beauty without having to deal with any preservatives or possible irritating ingredients. This product is fragrance free, which I love, making it safe for those with sensitive skin like me. This wonderful multi use product is perfect for no makeup makeup days. You can use it as a blush, lip tint & even as a flush of color on the eyes. It doesn’t feel greasy or too dry and glides on the skin with a luminous radiant finish. I use my fingers to grab some pigment and apply to my cheeks and lips. The shade Dear Ruby is nicely pigmented so you can layer it on for a deep look or just pop on a little for a light flush of color. It’s a beautiful bright shade that would look great on a variety of skin tones. Perfect for summer & fall! The packaging is sturdy and clicks close and doesn’t budge in your makeup bag. It’s sleek and small enough to fit in any purse/bag to easily bring on the go. I would recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful multi use product that can be used for the whole face whether you’re looking for a natural look or a full glam. I’m so excited to get my hands on the rest of the shades and add them to my collection!",Verified Buyer,18,6
maddy,4,cute and light,09/12/2023,"I recommend using your fingers to blend this in on the cheeks and the lips. When using a brush the brush picked up more of the color than it left. However I didnt have any issues with longevity after it ""dried down"". Very pretty color on my fair skin it looked natural.",Verified Buyer,2,7
Bethany,4,Nice multi stick,09/12/2023,Nice product. Apply with a brush for sure. Not loving the rose scent but it doesn’t last long.,Verified Buyer,1,1
Entwashian,4,Easy to use,09/12/2023,"I received an Ilia Multistick Cream Blush + Highlighter + Lip Tint from PinchMe in exchange for review. I chose the shade Dear Ruby since I wanted the juicy pop of watermelony coral-red for summertime. I found it to be easy to use with my fair skin without going full clown like some orange & red powder blushes I've tried. As a cream product, I found it easier to apply over bare skin/just skincare than over other makeup. It doesn't set down all the way, but it does have a sort of blurring, demi matte finish that means I don't have to worry about getting it everywhere if I accidentally touch my cheeks. For that reason, I prefer it as a cheek product rather than a lip tint. It also looks cute on the bridge of my nose. I did have a little trouble blending it into the hairline, but I feel that's to be expected with a cream product.",Verified Buyer,4,0
Priscella M.,5,Yes yes yes!!,09/12/2023,this muli stick is my go to lip tint and blush. I use it when I want a minimal makeup day! I love the color my skin and how it works so well with my undertones. ILIA brand is definitely winning me over with superior products!,Verified Buyer,4,2
Judith,4,Punchy Color,09/11/2023,"I'm a big fan of Ilia so I had high hopes for this multi stick. As a blush, this product works well. It's got a sheer, buildable color, so don't let the brightness fool you. It works the best when I blended it out with my finger as opposed to a brush or a sponge. My only critique of the blush is that it doesn't wear as long as I would like, but that's not a deal breaker. My favorite times to wear it were on my light makeup days, over a bb cream.
As a lip tint, this is a fail for me. A product that's meant to be blended out is never going to look great on the lips. It barely added any color, unless I really build it up. However, if I really build it up, then all the color settles into the fine lines on my lips. It just doesn't work for me. But if you're going for a super natural, barely there look, then maybe it could work for you.
All in all, I would still recommend.",Verified Buyer,10,0
Venitia R.,5,Marvelous Multi-stick,09/09/2023,"Love this product! Easy to use and just the right amount of product goes on, so it's not too much. Effortless flush added to skin and so easy to blend. I think makeup should be easy and not take too much time, so this is the perfect product for me. Love that it is good for your skin too! Thank you, Ilia!",Verified Buyer,0,0
V,5,Instantly added to my purse!,09/09/2023,"I've always heard good things about ILIA and the Multi-stick cream blush and lip tint did not disappoint! After warming it up on my wrist, the Multi-stick went on creamy and smooth to my lips and cheeks. The coverage was building and hydrating to the lips. I set the cream blush with powder blush and had no issues over my foundation. I also tried the Multi-stick on my bare face and it provides a dewy flush. Again easily buildable coverage and I used my fingers to blend out.",Verified Buyer,5,0
Julie,4,Buildable and lightweight!,09/08/2023,"The Ilia Multi-Stick Cream Blush + Highlighter + Lip Tint in the shade “Whisper"" is a buildable, lightweight formula that blends nicely. This color is subtle and perfect for my skin tone. It doesn't look cakey or interfere with foundation. For me, I don't think it was pigmented enough for use on my lips. I would recommend this to anybody who loves a good multi-stick - especially for a good cream blush. I was given this multi-stick for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",Verified Buyer,0,0
Valerie B.,5,Perfect Touch of Color,09/08/2023,"I wasnt sure how a multi stick would work out since there are so many formulas for things that go on your face. It was astounding that one product could fill the slots for many different uses. I was blown away by the pigment, texture, and wear of Ilia’s Multi-Stick Cream Blush. I wear it every time I put on makeup to add a little umph and color to my face",Verified Buyer,0,1
Candace Summers S.,5,A Glowing Wash of Color,09/07/2023,"I definitely took the challenge of using this item as a multi-stick. I used it as a blush, lip color and eyeshadow. I love that it is easily blendable and buildable if want more of a pop of color. It glides on smooth as silk and leaves a very natural wash of color. I like that it also leaves a slight glow. I am impressed by the ingredients and found the multi-stick to be very moisturizing. The chubby applicator makes it easy to use and store. I received this item from PinchMe for my honest review and I will be purchasing in other shades.",Verified Buyer,1,0
Angelina,5,So pretty,09/07/2023,I received this product as a free sample from Pinchme. I love the shade and the formula. Works beautifully on the whole face. I can use one product for a super cute look. Glides and blends like a dream.,Verified Buyer,0,0
Brianna,4,Easy to use and so pretty!,09/04/2023,"I love multi-use products and this is a good one.
I received the Ilia Multi-Stick as a free sample from Ilia and PinchMe in exchange for my unbiased opinion. I got the shade “a fine romance” which is a gorgeous berry color. I have pale cool-toned skin with lots of pink and I love how this shade looks on me. The chubby packaging is great for cheeks and surprisingly easy to use on the lips as well. This and some mascara would be perfect for travel to look pretty and fresh without having to pack a bunch of stuff. I wish it was a little easier to blend out on the cheeks. This will work best on its own over bare skin. Pop some highlighter on top to emphasize the rococo cherub look.",Verified Buyer,1,0
Kara,5,Gives my skin a glow,09/03/2023,"This shade is a peach/pink color that’s suitable for most skin tones. The stick doubles as a blush and lip balm. It is creamy and moisturizing with ingredients like Shea Butter, Orange Peel Wax, and Avocado Oil. It blends easily and leaves a subtle, very pretty, natural looking glow with a slightly dewy finish. I’ve tried applying it a few ways, and I like it best if I run a brush over it and then blend it on the cheeks.",Verified Buyer,5,1
Carlett S.,5,Love it!,09/03/2023,I love the color and how easy to use as a multi use makeup product.,Verified Buyer,0,0
Aracely,4,Natural Blush- Whisper,08/30/2023,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed using this product on my cheeks. It is easy to blend and gives a natural tint. It also lasted all day on me. I think this is great for traveling and natural makeup days. I did not like using it on the lips because the shade looked too light on my lips and settled into fine lines, but it's great as a blush!",Verified Buyer,0,0
Chelsea V.,5,LOVE,08/28/2023,The multi stick is a miracle worker! I love how smooth and versatile it is!! I feel so beautiful when wearing it. I already got a second color :),Verified Buyer,0,0
Rachel,5,Great multipurpose stick,08/26/2023,"I received the Ilia Multi-Stick for free for my honest review. I love a multipurpose beauty product, and this is a great one! The Whisper color gives my cheeks a light, natural blush. The color shows up more vibrant on my lips, and I really like the look. I found it very easy to apply and blend the color on my cheeks. This has been a go-to product in my travel makeup bag this summer.",Verified Buyer,1,0
Nicole S.,4,Great little stick,08/25/2023,"I received the ILIA Multi-Stick in A Fine Romance in exchange for my honest review. This is the first time I've ever used a product like this and I really love how easy this is to use. It nourishes my skin with shea butter and avocado oil for super soft lips and cheeks. The pigmentation is buildable and absolutely beautiful. This glides on without pulling or pilling at all. I used my finger to blend it in seamlessly. My only gripe is that when I scratched my cheek, some of the makeup came off, otherwise I am really loving this stick. I recommend you get one. Super compact and easy to use anywhere and anytime.",Verified Buyer,4,1
Bevin,5,Another Ilia Winner,08/24/2023,"I love everything from Ilia and was excited to try this new multi-stick. The color Whisper is super close to my natural lip color and works great for a finished no make up look. It goes on smooth and stayed on my lips for quite some time. I also used a little on my nose to match my natural cheek blush. I’ll definitely be keeping this in my make up bag for some easy, natural color.",Verified Buyer,0,0
Jennifer N.,3,"Light weight, light color",08/22/2023,"I used the shade Whisper, which looks really pretty in the tube. It goes on very light and sheer, meaning that the color didn't really transfer to my skin very well. It was a little hard to work with, I used my fingers and a large brush to blend it but perhaps a foam blender would work better. I was afraid that would take even more color off.
I don't usually wear much color on my lips, so this gave them a nice light glow. I received the multi stick cream blush + highlighter + lip tint by ILIA for free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest feedback.",Verified Buyer,4,0
Tika D.,5,Best blush ever!,08/15/2023,I am obsessed with this. It’s very versatile and can be used as a blush or lip tint. I am using the shade A Fine Romance. It's pigmented and blends out well and last for a long time throughout the day. Highly recommend this. I received this from pinchme in exchange for my honest review.,Verified Buyer,6,1

Charity F.,4,"Beautiful, buildable color",08/10/2023,"I love how buildable the color is for Whisper! I usually go for a more ""natural"" makeup look so I really blended this out into a beautiful sheer wash. However, it could definitely be used for a bold look. I also appreciate a blush/highlighter with no sparkles!! I have used it on my cheeks and lips with great results. The price is a little steep for the amount of product, but I think it's worth it.",Verified Buyer,4,0
jess,4,pretty pout,08/09/2023,i received this product as a free sample and i am pretty happy with it the color is really nice and naturally goes with my skin tone and they have other nice options as well. gave it a 4 star only because i am not too pleased with the taste or smell. love the ones that smell good,Verified Buyer,0,0
Rubi,5,Essential in my makeup routine,08/09/2023,I have used this product for a few weeks and I can say that I loved it!

Brianna,4,Nice Color!,08/06/2023,"I received this product free from Pinchme and Ilia for my honest review. I wanted a color that I normally wouldn't go for. So, I picked the color shade; Dear Ruby. I was running errands for the day and decided to wear it as a blush and a lip tint. I absolutely love this color as a lip tint. With the added gloss, it gave it a nice pop of color. I definitely see myself wearing this again. This is a product great for light makeup days.",Verified Buyer,7,1
Megan W.,4,Blush,08/06/2023,"I received this product for free from pinch me to review. At first when applying to the face, it removed the foundation underneath so I applied it to the back of my hand and use my finger to apply to the cheek and that worked for me.",Verified Buyer,2,0
Sarah,5,A new staple!,08/05/2023,"I received this Ilia multi-stick cream blush/highlighter/lip tint (shade: whisper) for free from PINCHMe. I'm a big fan of cream blushes so I had a feeling a would love this product - and I do! It is the perfect on-the-go stick that can be used for cheeks, eyelids and lips. I'm obsessed! The color is very buildable - can be subtle or bold based on your preference. It's extremely easy to use. I can't wait to try other colors based on the season.

Michelle B.,5,Pops,08/04/2023,I received this product in exchange for a review. 1st off love how it's a 2 and 1. I can use as blush or lipstick. I love how smooth it glides on my lips and gives me cheeks enough color.,Verified Buyer,1,0
BKR,4,Pleasantly pink and pretty,08/04/2023,"This stick makes doing my makeup routine a lot easier in the morning. As a blush, it went on smoothly and blended nicely. My cheeks had a sweet, pink hue. As a lippie, I had a nice berry color that lasted until lunch. My only complaint is my lips were left a little dry after use. All in all, though, this Is a good addition to any kit.",Verified Buyer,4,0
Meg C.,3,I really wanted to love this,08/04/2023,"I received this item from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review.
I really wanted to like this product and gave it several weeks before reviewing. I am a huge fan of lip tints and find them convenient and just the right amount of color.
This as a lip tint was more of a lipstick and after only a few hours it started to dry out and leave my lips with little clumps. I thought it might have been my issue, so I did a lip scrub and tried again...and again, but came up with the same issue each time. It's a gorgeous color, but not meant for long wear.
As a cheek color, it's fabulous and doesn't leave your face greasy feeling.
Overall it's a 3 out of 5 for me",Verified Buyer,5,0
Molly,5,Beautiful color,08/03/2023,This blush is so beautiful. I love the color and it’s so buildable and lasts all day. Great for a natural makeup look to full glam. I seriously cannot think of one bad thing about this product.,Verified Buyer,2,0
Deb,4,Good Product,08/03/2023,"I received this product free for my honest review. I was excited to try this product as it gives you the ability to use the product in more than one way. I typically don't use blush/highlighter as my cheeks get rosy with temperature change, emotions, etc. The light shade of the blush/highlighter went on smoothly and it was easy to blend using my fingertips. The slight color of the highlighter/blush complemented my skin and gave me a little pop of color. The lip tint was easy to apply and gave my lips a rosy little shine and color. The product was easy to apply and felt great on my skin. I am a minimalist when it comes to make-up and I received compliments about how it made me look. A great product.",Not Verifide,2,0
Rhonda A.,5,Excellent multi stick,08/02/2023,I received this product from ILIA and Pinchme in exchange for my honest review. I received the color Whisper and I am in love!

I will definitely buy more colors",Verified Buyer,1,0
Linh M.,5,Lovely!,08/01/2023,"I received Ilia Multstick for free in exchange for my honest review. I received the color Whisper which is described as a peach pink. Normally, peach tones do not look good on my Asian skin but this color is super flattering. I swipe on my lips first, then swipe on my cheeks and use a brush to swirl it in and tap along my cheeks. As far as longevity, cream blushes tend to not stay long but I think using a setting spray helps it. I like using the multi stick as part of a super quick routine when I am low on time but want to look fresh.",Verified Buyer,0,0
Camiv A.,5,Love me some whisper,07/30/2023,I receive this product via pinchme. I have been trying it for a few weeks and I can sincerely say I love it. I have medium tone skin color and this look very natural and is perfect for every day soft makeup look. I have been using it daily and it has become my favorite blush stick. I like that you can build it by adding more product for it to show more. It does last all day which is a plus. I tried it on the lips by itself and it is cute but it looks much better with lipliner underneath.,Verified Buyer,4,2
Clarisse Bartolome - D.,4,Beats Rare Beauty for me,07/29/2023,"I received a free sample from pinch me and I was shocked how much I loved this product. I’ve been using Rare Beauty since April but I will switch to this one. Stick lasts longer, no mess application. Only reason it’s 4/5 stars is because I wish they put some shimmer but I guess it wont look good on the lips if they do. I used Maybelline’s baby lips before applying to my lips. I love the effect looks almost like a lip oil",Verified Buyer,3,0
Amy W.,5,Just Lovely,07/29/2023,I received this in exchange for my review. I just love this stuff. This is my third shade of Multi Stick. It's just a really great product. It leaves me glowing but in a super natural way. I use it for work daily. It's nice to have a non-pink option for the summer and beyond.,Verified Buyer,5,1
Ashley B.,4,This multi-stick is perfect for travel!,07/29/2023,"I love that this stick is subtle enough to use on both my cheeks and lips, but has just enough color to brighten up my face, especially for minimal makeup days. It also works well as an extra pop of color after I set my face, or as a refresh to my makeup later in the day. I did notice that the product didn’t have a lot of payoff, and tended to stay in one spot. It worked better to melt the product by brushing it with my fingers to dispense enough to blend into my skin. Overall, the product is perfect to put into my bag and use throughout my day when I just need a little more glow!",Verified Buyer,1,0
Colette,5,My new choice for minimal makeup days!,07/27/2023,"Ilia's multi-stick adds luminous glow to skin and pop of color that works beautifully for minimalist, natural looks. I love how effortlessly it applies, and it appears as smooth as it feels. It blends easily with your fingers, making it a great on-the-go option. It's hydrating, avoiding the chalky dry texture that can come from a classic blush and adding a gorgeous, dewy finish. Without setting powder, I found it did wear off over the course of a long day but it's portability and ease of application offsets this being a problem. I used Whisper and while it was a bit more rosy on my complexion than I had expected, I really enjoy it for my summer looks!

Shevy L.,5,Pretty multi use stick,07/26/2023,I love how versatile the multi stick by ilia is. I chose whisper which is a peach pink color and is very pretty. It blends easily with fingers or brush.

Stacie H.,2,Would be a second option,07/26/2023,"I’m not a fan of creamy blushes, I’ve tried this only in my cheeks even though you can apply to your lips, I find creamy blushes difficult to blend into my cheeks. I do like the color though.",Verified Buyer,0,1

Brittney B.,5,Finally a cream blush winner!,07/21/2023,"I have had the hardest time finding a cream/liquid blush that I can use that doesn't lift/disturb the products underneath it, but this stick is a dream. It looks great over my foundation. It has the most beautiful lit from within glow, I don't even need to use highlighter when I have this on. I like that I don't have to be super careful while applying, it's not so super pigmented that it can ruin a makeup look if you apply too much, but it definitely isn't sheer. Perfect flush of color. I have applied this with a beauty blender, brush, and fingers. All work well but I prefer the sponge. I'm excited to order new shades. Thanks Ilia for this winner!",Verified Buyer,3,0
Carlene V.,5,Beautifully pigmented,07/21/2023,"I have the color “A Fine Romance.” I initially thought….oops this is too dark for my light/light/medium complexion but was pleasantly surprised and love the color. It is so buildable, so you can go shear or concentrate the color. I use on cheeks, eyes and so love it as a lip color. It blends beautifully! Highly recommend for the color and versatility.",Verified Buyer,5,0
Jodie F.,4,Beautiful Product,07/21/2023,"I am loving this cream blusher. I’m a big fan of cream products, especially in the spring/summer. I also love products that are multi-use. This didn’t disappoint. The formula is one of the best formulas I’ve tried. It’s soft enough that it is easy to apply without tugging on my skin. It’s really pretty as a lip color too. This has a beautiful pink/peach color that is natural looking. The pigmentation is perfect and you don’t need to worry about applying too much like some cream products. It blends nicely with your fingertips since it melts into the skin. It also works great with a brush. It gives a nice dewy finish and it dries down so it doesn’t feel sticky or tacky. You can really build up the color and it works great with the rest of my products. I also appreciate the fact that it doesn’t move around or remove my base makeup.",Verified Buyer,7,0

I tried it in the shade ""A Fine Romance"" and it's a lovely bright berry color that goes with my hair!

I was a little worried that the shade would be too intense for my skin tone, but this actually looked nice and took me a baby step out of my comfort zone. The color is vibrant and rich, but also slightly sheer - so not dark and heavy. The formula itself is so incredibly smooth and soft and left my lips feeling hydrated for the whole day, even after the color had largely faded.

Melanie Wink (.,4,"Lovely, natural color",07/16/2023,"After using the ILIA Multi-Stick, shade A Fine Romance, for 5 days on both cheeks and lips, I am mostly happy with the product. The packaging is nice a secure for carrying in purse or bag, and has a nice texture. I am usually looking for a somewhat natural look with my makeup and the color was perfect for what I was looking for. On my cheeks, I used my fingers to apply and blend. The pigment is not very dark and needed to be applied a few times to show up well. The product is not as smooth as I would like for blending and had to be worked quite a bit. On my lips, I also applied with fingers and was so very pleased with the results! The color is great, the product feels great, and after several days of wear, is not at all drying. Being a stick and not a stain, I did have to reapply a few times throughout the day, but that was expected and not a problem. Overall I am pleased and would recommend to friends looking for a muli-use color stick.",Verified Buyer,3,0

It added a subtle pop of color on my lips and cheeks. While I love the color, I felt like the product felt a bit heavy and sticky, especially on my cheeks. I'm prone to getting my pores clogged easily so I like lightweight products that I can't feel when I'm wearing it. I definitely felt this product on my skin. While I would use it on my lips, I would not use it on my cheeks as I feel like it would make me break out by clogging my pores. I've attached to pictures. The first is without the muli-stick and the second is with the stick being used on my lips and cheeks.",Verified Buyer,1,1

It’s a great addition to my summer makeup collection.",Verified Buyer,1,0

BeaHDiva,4,Overall Nice Product,07/12/2023,I received the ILIA Multi-Stick Cream Blush/Highlighter/Lip Tint for my honest review. This product is small but mighty. I would definitely add this to my makeup travel bag. I used this product primarily as a blush. Fine Romance is a nice berry color that compliments my skin-tone. It's a subtle blush that is buildable if you are looking for more drama. I deducted a star because (1) the price point and (2) you do have to do a bit of work to get the color payoff. Overall nice product.,Not Verifide,2,0

Alexis M.,4,Nice natural look for an atypical blush user,07/11/2023,"I received this product as a free trial from pinchme in exchange for my honest review.
I enjoyed using this multi stick! Disclaimer, I never use blush in my typical beauty routine. My normal makeup routine is (first layer to top) ilia c beyond serum in light, ilia skin tint in Balos, ilia concealer, Anastasia brow powder duo in taupe, ilia finishing powder, and occasional ilia mascara. I attached a makeup-free photo of myself and then a photo of myself with my typical makeup in addition to the multi stick. The multi stick went on beautifully smooth. I used just a little bit of pressure to not get a ton of color since I am quite pale. It blended in nicely with the rest of my makeup and complexion and didn’t look fake or made up. Since I have red undertones to my skin already, I’m not sure that I will make this a part of my normal skin routine, but I do like it for more fancy occasions or for when I know I will be photographed. I love that ilia products are very natural and cruelty free. I would recommend this product to those who like a natural looking blush. I cannot speak for how the color may look on the lips but like that it can also be used that way.",Verified Buyer,1,0
Tracy,4,"Good product, great color",07/11/2023,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.
I have lots of blush sticks and this one is nice, if not anything groundbreaking. First, the packaging is awesome, feels good in the hand while not feeling overly heavy, nice experience there. I love this color, which is a soft pink, and after I applied with a brush it looks nice and glowy. I didn't build it up too much, but I think it definitely could be buildable. I will say that there are similar products out there, but this is a good one: color is great (though there are similar ones out there) and doesn't move my foundation. The only other drawback is that it kinda smells like crayons, though I think that's common with stick formulations. Overall, I like it and would purchase again, maybe in a more exciting color.",Verified Buyer,0,0

Samantha,4,Pretty sheen,07/11/2023,"This product is really pretty. It blends easily on the cheeks and does offer a subtle glow so you don't need a highlighter - so two in one.

I spent the better part of the day running errands in heat and humidity. It lasted for roughly 5 hours before it began to fade. That’s a respectable performance, in my opinion.

Halie,4,"Pretty, natural",07/08/2023,"This product would be great for a no-makeup/natural look girlie! It was easy to use and gave a very pretty, light flush to the cheeks with a subtle sheen. The shade Whisper is super pretty and great for spring/summer. It's very light and buildable, so easy to avoid that clown look cream products can sometimes give. However, if you have a deeper skintone I'd pick a different shade or try to swatch in-store first as the color may be too light and sheer.
The product is a little bit sticky and my makeup transferred a little when I applied it directly on top of my skin tint, so be careful when applying. I also didn't love it as a lip product because of the distinctly Crayola smell and taste. Overall, I think this would be a great product for the right person - someone who loves an easy, natural look.

For Highlighter however, I usually do go with a lighter shade but I was able to use another highlighter with it and it really made the make up shine.

Leslie B.,5,Multi Stick in Watermelon Pink,03/11/2023,A great color I use year round. Looks natural. I use it on my cheeks and lips.,Verified Buyer,18,6
Meredith R.,5,Blendable,03/10/2023,"The product is quite sheer, which makes for a blendable product. I really like the color and want the exact color, but more pigmented for my lips.",Verified Buyer,16,7
Ashley M.,5,Love it,03/08/2023,Amazing product - easy to apply and looks great,Verified Buyer,9,9
Karen S.,5,Beautiful versatile palette!,03/02/2023,"I love this palette! Every color is wearable, breathable, and long lasting. Even the highlighter does just that..highlights without texture. On top of the super skin serum it looks amazing! I highly recommend!",Verified Buyer,28,8
Irene,3,The sticks and better than palette,02/28/2023,"Trying to put product on brushes or sponge was fruitless. It just disappears. So in my opinion you have to use your fingers to pick up enough product for it to show up, and only fingers for blending. It’s a VERY light wash, much lighter than sticks. I’ll probably use it but won’t repurchase.",Verified Buyer,16,12
Melody,5,Hands down the BEST BLUSH EVER,02/25/2023,"I keep coming back to buy more shades! I love the creamy texture, how well it blends and the best part is it’s so good on my skin. My skin has never broken out from any Ilia product. It’s hydrating but still light. Ruby Red is a MUST and In The City for contouring.",Verified Buyer,17,13
Shannon B.,5,Just enough color,02/16/2023,Love the versatility of this palette. I like the choice to see what tone I want on a particular day. I like a little color when I go for the no makeup look. I did not know what individual color to choose so this was perfect.,Verified Buyer,26,20
Jenna P.,5,love It,02/16/2023,"This shade is subtle and pretty, kinda like a rose gold colour on me. Love it on lips and cheeks",Verified Buyer,22,2
Natalie S.,4,Beautiful soft color,01/13/2023,"Tenderly gives such a beautiful soft wash of pink, just enough color to feel fresh for my day.",Verified Buyer,25,5
Zyra,4,Healthy/Dewy Looking Skin,01/06/2023,"This shade blends with the color of my skin making it unnoticeable and gives extra shiny/oily look. I have oily/combination skin and the serum foundation gives enough dew/glow that my skin needs, I find that applying this is unnecessary. If you have dry skin, this might work best for you. Using it makes skin look healthy so I'd still recommend it!
PS. ILIA is so kind to give a refund in coupon and let me keep the product, I'd love to try other shades of their multi stick",Verified Buyer,18,6

Heidi L.,5,On my 5th stick of ‘All of Me’!,11/29/2022,"Hands down the best blush I’ve ever used! Creamy, easy application and blending, great pigment, and buildable, I love the glow this blush gives my skin and how it leaves me looking sun kissed year round.",Verified Buyer,25,0
Ginger Amy T.,5,I love my new ilia products!,10/25/2022,I’ve slowly been transitioning to clean beauty products and I’m so happy with the look and feel of each item. This multi stick is perfect for my cheeks and lips. I love the color and the staying power.,Verified Buyer,49,1

Meily G.,5,Lipstick Review,10/05/2022,I love the color and texture!,Verified Buyer,17,1
Kristi R.,3,Not as deep,09/07/2022,"It feels nice. Color is good, but you have to use a lot to get the depth of color you want. Also doesn’t have a very nice scent. I actually think they tried to make it have no sense at all but it ends up smelling like slightly chemical and slightly like wax. I would expect a little bit of fragrance for a high-end feel.not as creamy as I expected.",Verified Buyer,26,10
Brittany M.,4,Totally Blushing,08/06/2022,"My first blush purchase ever. Seriously, first ever. I am in love 😍 The fact that I can use this as a cheek/lip combo is a major bonus.",Verified Buyer,48,41
Renee S.,5,Love this cheek and lip duo!,08/04/2022,One of my favorite products! I love how this multi stick adds a pop of color to my cheeks and lips. Looks natural on my skin. I can’t wait to order more beautiful colors to try out. I know what’s on my Christmas list. :),Verified Buyer,53,47
Shandy H.,5,So easy to use!,07/30/2022,"I LOVE THESE! They glide on silky smooth but have a matte finish and it’s easy to apply like a chapstick. The colors are gorgeous, Tenderly gives me that light, fresh pop of color that looks natural.",Verified Buyer,41,166
Kate C.,5,Easy on the go,07/29/2022,"Love this blush stick! I’m a big fan or cream blush and this one didn’t disappoint. It’s So pretty, easy to apply and love the buildable color. Also doubles as a matte softening lip sheer/balm. Easy pop in your purse for a quick touch up on the go or pick me up in the middle of the day. This product doesn’t add gloss or shine, hopefully this review helps someone out! I’ll definitely be buying more in other colors!",Verified Buyer,26,0
MICHELLE H.,5,I love this multi stick,07/22/2022,"Loving this shade “at last”, nice buildable color, perfect on my lips. Great for traveling and simplifying my makeup routine for lips and cheeks. These things are genius !",Verified Buyer,29,15
Jane K.,5,Love the glow,07/21/2022,I love the shimmery peachy color of “In the Mood”. The product is creamy and easy to apply. Looks beautiful on skin and leaves a nice glow. Nice on lips too for a natural look.,Verified Buyer,14,2
louise m.,5,Variety Rules!,07/13/2022,This is the best! I even love the colors I wouldn’t normally wear- In the City is exquisite! So easy to apply and looks dewy and moist! TY😊,Verified Buyer,38,14
Jonique H.,5,Effortless Natural Glow,07/06/2022,"The ILIA Multi-Stick Cream Blush + Lip Tint is so effortless to use for a subtle, juicy glow. You can dab it on your face and lips and use a brush to blend it out on your cheeks and it just melts into your skin. The color Dear Ruby works really well on my dark complexion which I was very happy about. It looks like it could be a little bright, but it adapts to my skin and lips a bit and has no chalkiness in the color. Great for everyday looks or in the case of using it as blush, also a glam beat.",Verified Buyer,28,0
Colleen S.,5,"Easy to apply, great for travel, works well for my skin tone",07/05/2022,"One thing that I love about using the multi-stick as a blush is how compact it is — no brushes or tools needed. Very easy to swipe on and blend. While I like this as a blush, it is a bit light in color for my lips. Overall, love the versatility and how moisturizing this feels over my other makeup.",Verified Buyer,12,1
Miranda N.,4,Lovely wash of color,07/05/2022,I use this in the morning on cheeks and lips (and I keep Lady Bird in my bag for lip touch ups during the day). I love the natural cheek flush this gives. I’m less in love with it after the first lip application since the faint shimmer builds up and looks mildly dry later in the day.,Verified Buyer,14,1
Theresa B.,5,Natural sun kissed look,07/03/2022,"In the Mood gave me a natural sun kissed glow! Easy to apply, so soft and subtle!",Verified Buyer,6,0
Morgan B.,2,Too much product needed,07/03/2022,"Too much product was needed to show the pigment and, although the colors are pretty, there was so much needed that it very rapidly sweated off within 25 minutes and came off easily if lightly touched. There was product all over my sunglasses after a 20 minute walk",Verified Buyer,28,0
Barbara T.,5,Perfect,06/28/2022,Perfect color,Verified Buyer,9,3
Kim W.,5,Perfect multitasker,06/25/2022,Love this. I use it as contour or blush and eyeshadow. It’s perfect. Highly recommend.,Verified Buyer,10,2
Sharon G.,5,Love color,06/24/2022,This is the right amount of colour and creamy coverage.,Verified Buyer,10,3
alexis s.,4,Dreamer,06/17/2022,I received Ilia’s Multi-Stick Cream Blush + Lip Tint in the shade Dreamer which is listed as a warm nude on Sephora’s website but Terracotta on Ilia’s website. I think it has a nice warm pinky-nude color. It is nice that goes on smoothly and you can build it up (or not). It contains quite a bit of product and at the same time is in a nice small container. I also love that it is a Clean beauty product.,Verified Buyer,13,2
Janet L.,5,Awesome multi-functional product that helps create the beautiful natural look that I love.,06/15/2022,"This Ilia Multi-stick sample was sent to me free in exchange for my honest opinion. The shade is in the color, ""Whisper"". I love a peachy-pink shade of blush, but as I have aged, powder blush just does not work on my dry skin. This product is just perfect for my skin! It did not dry my skin out at all and did not sink into my tiny wrinkles like powder blush does. I applied it with my fingers, and it is very soft and easy to apply and left such a natural flush as if the color was coming from within. I also applied the product to my lips, and it gave me just perfect amount of color to look natural and not too made up. I am looking forward to trying the highlight shades next!",Verified Buyer,17,1
Brandi Y.,3,Not my favorite,06/12/2022,"I’m learning I’m not the target audience for Ilia products so if you love Ilia already, you probably will enjoy this product. I prefer my skin to feel velvet, not dewy and this stays moist/waxy feeling in my skin and is too shiny. When I apply setting powder it looks uneven. It also looks cakey on my lips and isn’t moisturizing enough to be used as a tinted lip balm. I think these are for people that want natural skin with a little pop, where I want makeup to transform my appearance and last all day. I received free to try but I wouldn’t purchase or recommend.",Verified Buyer,27,0
Ang,5,Lovely & smooth!,06/12/2022,"I really like this ilia multi-stick! It goes on nice & smooth and makes my lips feel so soft. Once applied, I found the color to be more subtle than I thought it would be & for me that's a good thing. Using the stick for lips & cheeks is especially convenient for nights out and weekenders.",Verified Buyer,19,0
Rachel N.,5,Love!,06/05/2022,Colors are great and goes on so well!,Verified Buyer,13,1
Paula T.,5,Perfect Spring Color,05/29/2022,This color is rich and so lovely. It is the perfect color for Spring- peachy bright happiness.,Verified Buyer,3,0
Destiny J.,5,Amazing multi-use stick,05/16/2022,I loved how smooth this went on and it was easy to blend out. It is very pigmented but the colors are so complimentary that it’s not too overwhelming to the face. I’ve used it multiple times and it just gives a beautiful color and glow that looks natural.,Verified Buyer,14,1
Summer A.,5,Love Multi Stick Palette,05/14/2022,I am already a fan of several of the multi sticks. The palette gave me an opportunity to try several new colors. But the big bonus is convenience. It is great for sticking in your purse or travel. This one small palette allows you to choose from several multi stick colors as well as highlighting and contouring options in one. Very easy make-up that feels great on your skin.,Verified Buyer,22,1
April M.,4,Pretty Good,05/14/2022,I definitely like the variety of colors. I never usually get through entire sticks of product so having small pots of a variety of color is great. The colors are pretty and vary so that helps to get a taste of many that they offer and see which ones I use the most. The consistency is very sheer and creamy and it smells a little like lipstick which is a bit odd but I am willing to keep trying it. I am wearing just a bit of the whisper color. It seems pretty easily buildable because the consistency is so creamy I am not sure if it will have a lot of staying power but since I don’t wear makeup for hours and hours it will probably last long enough for me. I do like the natural look the makeup overall.,Verified Buyer,14,0
Stacy C.,5,Great color!,05/09/2022,I absolutely love this color! It's a great color for spring summer and freshened up my makeup for the warmer weather!,Verified Buyer,8,2
Julie F.,5,Love the sheer color,05/07/2022,This is my second color. I also have at last but wanted a more neutral color as well. Goes on so smoothly and feels great on my skin. Very moisturizing!,Verified Buyer,14,1
Marcia S.,5,At Last !,05/04/2022,I love this color and product! Makes my skin glow !,Verified Buyer,21,0
Marielys C.,5,Blends well,05/04/2022,This color goes on easily and blends very well. I use it on my cheeks and lips. But i like it more as a blush.,Verified Buyer,8,1
DRAGONFLY N.,5,Natural color for all over the face!,04/30/2022,"I received this Multi-Stick in the shade ¨a fine romance¨ (berry-pink shade) complimentary for my review. You can use this all over your face: cheeks, eyelids and lips. I applied it and blended it out with my fingers very quickly. It left a very natural flush as a blush, or eyeshadow wich I love and on lips is very pretty too, not greassy or drying either.
I love this product to create a monochromatic and easy look every day. Totally recomend it.
I received this #freeproduct #sponsored from #pinchme #happypincher and #iliabeauty in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",Verified Buyer,7,4
CANDICE D.,4,Fun Pop of Color,04/28/2022,"This is my first cheek/lip purchase from Ilia. The colors are fun and flattering, and I like having a lot of options to try out. The only thing I feel like is that it's so blendable, it seems like it's easy to over-blend and lose all the color. This may be more of a user error, but I'd like to try a multi stick to see how it's coverage compares.",Verified Buyer,16,0
Ellen M.,5,Stella by starlight perfect for spring!,04/27/2022,I am so happy with the multi stick Stella by Starlight! It gives me a nice glow without too much extra color. I apply it over “Bom” serum tint and have been using a mix of “hold me” and “memoir” hydrating lip balm to finish my routine. I like that basically all of Ilia’s products are buildable for light or more businesslike applications.,Verified Buyer,17,1
Jacqui B.,5,"Mom, dental office mgr, wife , always on the go",04/26/2022,I love this palette and combine a few colors to get a perfect glow. The palette enabled me to try numerous shades and I use it every day now. So natural looking as well!,Verified Buyer,12,0
Taylor S.,5,Simple & Amazing,04/24/2022,"I love the variety and simplicity of this kit! Makes me excited to get ready quickly and throw on some color to my face, and blend colors together to make the perfect shade. It’s just the best buildable natural glowy look!",Verified Buyer,22,0
Marijke K.,5,10/10!!,04/20/2022,LOVE this product. Thanks PinchMe and Ilia! The cream blush works really well over foundation and contour and blends out like a dream. It’s also the perfect size for travel which is a bonus now that the return to office& in person is happening. I am definitely going to make this my go-to blush!,Verified Buyer,13,0
Sheryl J.,5,New Palette,04/20/2022,I am so happy with my new palette. The colors all work well with my skin tone and it travels neatly in my purse for touch ups. I would definitely buy another if there are more of these to come.,Verified Buyer,25,2
Patti S.,5,Glow and Radiant,04/19/2022,I received this Ilia Multi Stick Cream Blush + Lip Tint free from PINCHme. This looks very natural and feels natural. It blends well with my fingers and it's made with clean ingredients. It's hydrating on my dry skin and it makes me look glowy and radiant.,Verified Buyer,11,2
Sophia h.,5,Easy to Use & Favorite Color,04/15/2022,"LOVE this color!! So excited poppy red was a new option. This is a single swipe on each cheek & one on the lips. Sometimes do 6-8 dabs on each cheek for a lighter look. Could definitely get more intense color with additional swipes, but this is enough for me. Feel glowy, made up, but natural.
I touch this up in the afternoon, as it fades a bit more than the color haze pigment, but I like the look of it with the matira skin tint and wakiki run powder. So when I add some wakiki powder for an extra SPF dose in the afternoon and use dear ruby as my lipstick, I'll dab some on my cheeks to touch them up too. Quick, easy, and back to life.",Verified Buyer,17,0
Christina B.,5,Perfect highlight,04/14/2022,Love the light creamy feel of this highlighter. Blends easily.,Verified Buyer,8,0
Mellonie V.,5,I'm a fan!,04/13/2022,"I love this multi stick. You can use it anytime and anywhere. I used both with and without makeup. It's great for giving you a tint of color, or you can stack it and make it darker.",Verified Buyer,10,1
